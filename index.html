                         <p>
                         Luke Reaux and I have been married for a little over a year now, and have realized we have one major thing in common…pets! We have a very compassionate heart for any and every animal. 
                              
                         When I was a young girl, I always had cats and dogs. I have seen many different forms of personalities from each pet I’ve owned, and loved them unconditionally. 
                         Animals have also surrounded Luke throughout his child hood, giving him a strong love and knowledge on how to care for dogs.
                         </p>
                         <img id="aboutUsImg" src="images/pups.JPG" align="right">
                         <p>
                         When Luke and I met 5 years ago, I had a loving Golden Retriever Jake, who was my world. During Luke and I’s relationship, we would take Jake everywhere. After 11 short years, he passed away due to cancer. I told Luke that I knew my calling was to care for pets, and to show my conditionally love to each one the way Jake had showed to me. Ironically, Luke realized he had the same calling! We knew that eventually we would start doing something involving the care for animals, but what?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                         A little over a year ago in June, Luke and I got married. We now have two inside dogs and two outside. Our inside dogs, Bentley and Rita, have a great life with us. They are flowing with attention and love daily. Sampson and Letty, our outside German Shepherds, have a large yard to roam and play. They enjoy our daily fetch time and look forward to their nightly snacks! 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                         We both have a very high-end knowledge of how to care for pets and how to make them a major part of our family. We include them in all that we can! Now, we are looking for a way to enjoy pets and help pet owners. Well we have found it, pet sitting!
                         </p>
                         <p>
                         From the comfort of our home, we have everything we need to provide adequate care for your loved ones! We have a two-acre yard fenced in, and a smaller separate fence for our large dogs. We have a home, with a large area for your little ones to roam and play. Our two little dogs in our home are very friendly and love having new pups to play with. With our experience of having pets, we know exactly how to keep your dog or cat entertained! They will be treated like royalty and part of our family! 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                         We also know the struggles of leaving your pet behind while leaving for vacation. Especially, when you don’t get any contact on how they are doing. Not here! You will receive as little or as much updates as you want. We will send you photos and videos of how you little buddy is doing. If you need anything or just want to say hi to your pet, call us anytime between 8am and 8 pm.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                         Here at Just Paws we want your pets stay to be just as relaxing for them as it is for you. We promise to treat your pet as if they were our own and we promise to care for them unconditionally. 
                         </p>
